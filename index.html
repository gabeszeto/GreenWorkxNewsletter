                    Biden-Harris administration's investment in EV charging infrastructure creates new green-tech jobs
                </h4>
                <h6 class="boxText">
                    The Biden-Harris administration has announced a substantial $623 million grant to advance the expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure across the United States, addressing the current 'charging void.' This move aligns with the government's commitment to combat climate change and promote sustainable transportation. The funding, part of the broader $7.5 billion allocation for EV charging infrastructure from the bipartisan infrastructure package, focuses on building charging hubs at high-demand locations which aim to boost EV adoption and support the sharing economy in transportation. Notably, the initiative is expected to create significant job opportunities in construction, green-technology, and customer service. Despite facing opposition in Congress, the administration's commitment to cleaner transportation is evident with the opening of the first funded charging station, showcasing tangible progress.

                    Insights from PwC's 2023 State of Climate Tech Report
                </h4>
                <h6 class="boxText">
                    Investment in climate tech faced a 40% dip in 2023, hit by economic uncertainties and global tensions, as per PwC's 2023 State of Climate Tech report. However, the decline was less severe compared to the 50% average fall in other sectors. Despite challenges, climate tech's share of venture capital and private equity funding rose to over 10%, up from 7% in 2018. Notably, there's a shift toward more efficient spending on emissions reduction. Investors are now showing interest in mid-stage deals over early-stage ones, and more first-time investors are entering the climate tech space. The report suggests a continued allure for the industry.

                    PwC also reports a 26% decrease in green job listings in the UK compared to the record levels of 2022, while total advertised roles have fallen by 29% in 2023. The green sector shows more resilience with its share in the UK labor market increasing to 2.3% from 1.9% in 2021. However, the decline in overall demand for green jobs poses challenges for the UK's goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. PwC emphasizes the need for a significant increase in new green jobs, noting that it's crucial to ensure a just transition to a low-carbon economy, spreading benefits across sectors and regions. Scotland leads in green job creation, accounting for 4% of advertised jobs, exceeding the UK average of 2.32%. Green jobs, concentrated in "white collar" roles, tend to offer higher pay and job satisfaction, with entry-level roles commanding a 23% pay premium on average.

                    Macro Trends in Workforce Dynamics: a shift from early retirement to the 'Great Unretirement'
                </h4>
                <h6 class="boxText">
                    A significant portion of individuals in their 50s and 60s are contemplating early retirement, with 39% considering it likely. While some retirees leave their jobs for positive reasons like family time, others are compelled to do so due to health concerns or skills deficits. The societal impact includes reduced economic activity, productivity challenges, and a potential brain drain from companies. Retiring early also poses challenges for businesses, as workers over 50 bring valuable experience and knowledge. The individual impact varies, with some leaving jobs they enjoy due to circumstances beyond their control. The key question for policymakers and business leaders is how to better support this age group and keep more employees in the labour market. Research suggests that skills, training, and development are effective ways to incentivize individuals over 50 to stay in the workforce. Digital transformation poses challenges, with concerns about adapting to new technology and feeling deprioritized compared to younger colleagues. There are a significant number of individuals contemplating early retirement due to difficulties keeping up with modern workplace skills. Addressing skills gaps through upskilling and reskilling is crucial, requiring a focus on training, development, and better preparation for changing skill requirements. The UK aim to transition from the "great retirement" to the "great unretirement" by understanding and acting upon the mechanisms that can have a substantial impact, such as return programs for those seeking opportunities to re-enter the workforce.
